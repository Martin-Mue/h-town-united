-- Adds manual_release (20260826140000) to the owner-lock trigger's protected settings-column
-- list, matching every other organizer-only tournament setting. Base body copied byte-for-byte
-- from the CURRENT live function (verified via pg_get_functiondef immediately before writing
-- this, matching 20260825120200's already-applied prestart_views clause) — see that migration's
-- own comment for why copying from the live function rather than an assumed file history matters
-- in this project (20260822090000 got this wrong once already).
